-Project started Mar. 8th
-Is this a popular game? I never knew this game in my life before this.
-Project finished Mar. 10th
-Working with the ai really ate up my time (and it was frustrating as I tried multiple methods for no reason. I should have stuck with one). I could try to make the ai better, but I worked on it too much and I'm sick of working on ai right now. I think it is safe to move on.
-Overall, I think it actually went really nice, up until working on the ai at least, when I worked on this project. I remembered myself failing horribly at OOP back in 2013 when I was a student at UMICH. This was the first OOP project that I truly finished and is runnable. I'm sure it's sloppy as hell but I'm proud of it. Let's move on to the next step.
